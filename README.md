# Theia
## Cardano Stake Pool Reachability Dashboard

<i>In Greek mythology, Theia is the goddess of sight.</i>

Theia is a tool to monitor Cardano stake pool relays, as registered on the blockchain. 

[cncli](https://github.com/AndrewWestberg/cncli) ping is used to determine if each relay is online and running
a recent version of the Cardano protocol. 

See the [ping README.md](ping/README.md) for instructions on running the `process_pool.py` and `ping_relay.py` tools
which gather the information for Theia dashboard. 

See the [dashboard README.md](dashboard/README.md) for instructions on building and deploying the Theia dashboard.
